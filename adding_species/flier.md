description: what you need to do to attend the hackathon and get your species added to the stdpopsim catalogue
---


# Details

The hackathon's goal will be to expand the number of species
in the stdpopsim catalogue,
and will take place **April 8-9, 2021**, online.
Times TBD.

To express interest:

- add yourself to [this form](https://forms.gle/mX9r38VqDE7j9xCT8)

and we'll contact you with details.

To help make sure we get the species added,
**you** will need to:

- have used stdpopsim or attend an *introduction to stdpopsim* workshop
- attend our *contributing* workshop (see below)
- be able to use git and bash
- be moderately familiar with coding and debugging python.

... and, the **species** you'd like to add should have:

- a chromosome-scale assembly
- a recombination map or at least an estimated total map length
- a demographic model, or at least an estimate of effective population size
- a mutation rate estimate, or some reasonable default (e.g., 1e-8)

You can still attend, and help, if you don't have a particular species in mind.

# "How to contribute" workshop, week of March 11th

To contribute, you'll need to know some python,
and be able to use the command line to move around files and run commands.

You'll also need to be familiar with the basic structure of the stdpopsim library
and how we build a highly collaborative project like this one using git and github.
To get you up to speed on this, we'll be offering a workshop,
probably 2 or 3 times, in different time zones, the week of March 11th.
Before this workshop, you should have:

- a github account, and 
- introductory knowledge of git, as you might get from a short "intro to git" tutorial.
