# Introduction to stdpopsim Workshop

## Setup for Workshop

Important!
At least 15 minutes before the workshop:
1. Click the JupyterHub link (http://167.71.183.31/)
2. Log in with your user name 
   - your user name is your email address
   - your password will be whatever you first input as a password
3. In the top right corner click "New" -> "terminal" (this will open a terminal window)
4. Clone the GitHub repository
```
git clone https://github.com/popsim-consortium/workshops.git
```
*Note:* If you are asked for username/password when cloning the repository,
double-check the URL - you probably have a typo.


### Screen setup

In this workshop we will be using four different windows - 
The zoom call, the GitHub and JupyterHub, the stdpopsim catalog, and Slack.
We highly recommend during the workshop participants have two monitors available. 
If you only have one monitor available, you may choose to flip through the necessary windows,
or you can have all four windows up at once. 
Here is a recommendation on how to arrange your screen with all four windows.
